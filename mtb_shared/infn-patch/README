This location holds the Infinera specific changes to the Cypress code pulled from github.

## Changing source code

Files in this location are pulled from Cypress github so any updates here that are Infinera specific
must be specially tracked so that the respective changes are not lost during a component upgrade.
Infinera changes will be tracked through patch files stored in mtb_shared/infn-patch/ and should have
naming consistent with `<mtbDirectoryPatchIsFor>-<jiranumber>-<uniqueId>.patch`. Patch files can be
created using git diff and redirecting the output to a file.

- `git diff > mtb_shared/infn-patch/my-patch-file-name.patch` - This should always be done with respect
to amcu\ directory level. You may add arguments like `git diff --staged > mtb_shared/infn-patch/my-patch-file-name.patch` if you already added the code but have
not committed or `git diff COMMITHASH~ COMMITHASH > mtb_shared/infn-patch/my-patch-file-name.patch` if you already have committed the mtb_shared changes. The
"uniqueId" field can just be an incrementing number starting at 0 to avoid same file names.
- If you have changes other than mtb_shared changes included in your new patch file, manually remove
those from the contents. The new patch only needs to track the changes made to file in mtb_shared
directories only.
- Commit your new patch file
